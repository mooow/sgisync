# sgisync #

This tool allows you to download magazines from sgi-italia.org (`sgidl.py`) and 
sync them to a folder in your Google Drive (`SgiSync`, which uses my own google 
drive interface, `gdrive.py`)

## Configuration files ##
You can find example Configuration files in `skeleton`
* **sgidl_login.conf**: There you will put your username and password to access 
sgi-italia.org

which Google Drive folder you want to sync them
